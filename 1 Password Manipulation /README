Given that 3 students had changed their password a total of 4 times each, Program 1's prompt asked me to write a program that would store each students' change in a 2D array and derive info from it. Some examples of this included checking if an input String matched any recorded password, finding which password was the longest, changing all stored passwords to String "unlock", and identifying which student changed their password the most.
