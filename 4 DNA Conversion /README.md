Given a textfile containing characters representing a DNA strand's bases, Prompt 4 asked me to write a program that utilizied Scanners, StringBuilders, and PrintWriters to translate the DNA's nucelotides into RNA and output it to another text file. Additionally, the RNA file was then paired in with a pre-made RNA-Protein conversion text file, which with application as a HashMap was used to to translate the RNA into protein. This project included defined exception handling, input/output, and data structure utilization.
