Given a 1D array, Program 2's prompt asked me to write a program that would initialize an ArrayList and provide several ArrayList-focused methods for modification. Examples of this modification included reversing an ArrayList's contents, only keeping all odd-indexed elements, reversing and only keeping all even-indexed elments, and continously removing elements until only 1 remained.
