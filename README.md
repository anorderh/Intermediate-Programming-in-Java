# INTRODUCTION

This repository contains all my submitted programs for CS 108 during the Spring 2020 semester. As well as each .java file containing proper documentation, each project folder will contain a README file further explaining its use.

The following project files demonstrate understanding of the following topics:

  1. Programming and problem solving in computer science.
  2. Pseudocode, problem abstraction and implementation.
  3. The object-oriented programming paradigm.
  4. Encapsulation, information hiding, static/non-static, inheritance, polymorphism and early/late binding.
  5. Abstract, interface, generic, reference and primitive data types.
  6. Strongly vs. loosely typed languages.
  7. Error handling; expected vs. unexpected errors.
  8. Iteration, recursion and data traversal.
  9. Algorithms and basic algorithmic efficiency.
  10. Data structures; lists, trees, stacks and queues.
  11. Streams, IO and Files.
