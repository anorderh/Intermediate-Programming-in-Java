Prompt 5 asked me to make use of Java's OOP paradigm by defining several classes labeled "Customer", "Account", "Deposit", Savings", and "Checking" and implementing an information depository as well as UI for a theoritical bank. Incorporating interfaces, abstract classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, I was able to attribute specific qualities to certain objects with common parents and get a better understanding of OOP's benefits.
