Prompt 7 asked me to create a program that defined the implementation for a RingBuffer data structure, utilizing several int variables as index pointers to the front and rear as well as one to represent size. In doing so, despite all elements of the base array initialized upon the constructor's call, the int variables specified the RingBuffer's operating borders and allowed for constant reshaping.
