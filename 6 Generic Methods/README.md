Given either ArrayLists or arrays, Prompt 6 asked me to create a program offering several extrapolation & modification methods that utilizied type parameters and type bounds while also accounting for both data structures. Some examples of these methods include removing duplicates, shuffling elements, finding the largest element (through Comparable), and a linear search's implementation.
